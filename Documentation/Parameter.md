| Parameter | Unit | Explanation |

| refinement_steps | | Defines the number of grid-node refinements. [1..n] Each refinement doubles the number of grid points in each direction. Be carefull: Each refinement step needs eight times (2^3) the memory of the previous step! |
| stepwidth_z | eV | Stepwidth in the outer integral in Eq. 2 in [2] - Accuracy: 0.04 eV (low quality, may be to large, E_F is near a band edge), 0.01 eV (normal quality). |
| z_stop | nm | Upper limit for z-integration in transmission coefficients. Standard value: 200 nm, large values enhance accuracy of the tunnel currents but take longer. |
| omega | |Relaxation parameter for under-relaxation of the Newton iteration method. For semiconductors, values around 0.2 are suggested by Selberherr[1]. Decrease this value, if the solution diverges. |
